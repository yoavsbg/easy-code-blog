## So, how can you speed your project?

- Components are un-styled and allows full customisation.
- Supports animation with both CSS and JS libraries.
- Amazing accessibility conformance and thoughtful API design.
- Allows server side rendering of components along with responsive     styles.
- Allows including components individually (modular NPM packages), thus enabling incremental adoption.
